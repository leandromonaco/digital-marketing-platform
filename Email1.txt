Hi Leandro,

I see that you recently registered for a webinar on Microsoft Azure, and I'd like to offer our support in answering any questions you might have as you get started.

Our team of Microsoft cloud technology specialists can answer questions about getting started, architecture and design, or help with a proof of concept. We're also happy to help with any pricing or estimating questions you may have.

Would you like me to connect you with someone on our team?

Thanks,
